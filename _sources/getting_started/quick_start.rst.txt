===========
Quick start
===========

In this quick start guide, we’re showing you three things, how to:

    #. install Cloudkeeper for AWS with docker
    #. use the Cloudkeeper CLI to run your first ``collect`` process
    #. query the results of the collect process 

The docker set-up takes 2-5 minutes. The duration of the first collect process depends on the size of your environment - usually 5-10 minutes. 

| Examples and data in this documentation are based on a small AWS `Cloud9 <https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/>`_ environment.
| To start exploring you need AWS credentials and a working Docker environment with access to AWS APIs.
| We assume you are familiar with basic Docker operations and how to operate a Linux shell.

Install & Run Cloudkeeper
=========================

AWS Credentials
---------------
For this demo, you need an `AWS IAM User <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html>`_ with `Access Key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html>`_.
Make sure the user has the permissions to access your cloud resources.

You can look up specific permission configurations in your :ref:`access-permissions` section.

Run Cloudkeeper
---------------
Assuming `docker <https://www.docker.com/get-started>`_ is already present, run the latest Cloudkeeper release.
Replace ``YOURKEYID`` and ``YOURACCESSKEY`` to collect your AWS inventory.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir -p ~/data/test
    $ docker run -d -v "${HOME}/data/test":/data:rw \
    -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOURKEYID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='YOURACCESSKEY' \
    -e CKWORKER_COLLECTOR='aws example' \
    --name cloudkeeper ghcr.io/someengineering/cloudkeeper:2.0.0a6

Start the Cloudkeeper CLI
=========================
You interact with `ckcore <https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper/tree/main/ckcore>`_ via `cksh <https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper/tree/main/cksh>`_

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker exec -it cloudkeeper cksh


| `ckcore <https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper/tree/main/ckcore>`_ the platform maintaining the `MultiDiGraph <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph#Directed_multigraph_(edges_with_own_identity)>`_.
| `cksh <https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper/tree/main/cksh>`_ the Cloudkeeper shell to interact with the core.

Collect AWS Inventory
---------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    > start_task collect
    > tasks
    id: 501d6048-1e2e-11ec-ace0-330e870b1c75
    started_at: '2021-09-25T18:28:00Z'
    descriptor:
    id: collect
    name: collect


Depending on infrastructure size, the collect process usually takes anywhere between 2-5 minutes. Huge cloud accounts (>500+ instances) can take up to 15 minutes.


The ``collect`` task runs every full hour. Cloudkeeper persists data in $HOME/data/test/db (`ArangoDB <https://www.arangodb.com/learn/>`_) and $HOME/data/test/tsdb (`Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/>`_).

| *Hint:*
| You can observe the collect process in the logs

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker logs -f cloudkeeper | grep ckcore cloudkeeper.log | grep 501d6048-1e2e-11ec-ace0-330e870b1c75

You have this many ressources!
------------------------------
Count the resources available in Cloudkeeper

.. code-block:: bash

    > match is(resource) | count
    total matched: 280
    total unmatched: 0

What is your number? Let us know on `Discord <https://discord.gg/someengineering>`_!


Usage of the Cloudkeeper CLI
============================
In this section we show you how to use Cloudkeeper CLI(`cksh <https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper/tree/main/cksh>`_) to discover your infrastructure by selecting, filtering and counting your resources.

How to access help
------------------------------------------------
| `cksh <https://github.com/someengineering/cloudkeeper/tree/main/cksh>`_ ``help`` command list all commands available.
| Guidance for a specific command is ``help <command>``

.. code-block:: bash

    > help
    ckcore CLI
    Valid placeholder string:
    @UTC@ -> 2021-09-25T19:11:19Z
    [...]
    Available Commands:
    add_job - Add job to the system.
    [...]
    Available Aliases:
    match (reported) - Matches a property in the reported section.
    [...]
    Note that you can pipe commands using the pipe character (|)
    and chain multiple commands using the semicolon (;).

This cksh output is shortened for readability.

List your resource types
------------------------
``kind`` lists all resource types currently available for exploration.

.. code-block:: bash

    > help kind
    > kind
    [...]
    - aws_account
    - aws_alb
    - aws_alb_quota
    - aws_alb_target_group
    - aws_cloudformation_stack

Query your resource types
-------------------------
``match`` matches the collected values from your AWS Infrastructure

.. code-block:: bash

    > help match
    > match is(aws_ec2_instance) limit 1
    reported:
    kind: aws_ec2_instance
    id: i-03df836cdd46e2f94
    tags:
        aws:cloud9:environment: 7135ada88b05425aa8a6238dd30b58af
        email: neil@some.engineering
        Name: aws-cloud9-keepercore-documentation-7135ada88b05425aa8a6238dd30b58af
        aws:cloudformation:logical-id: Instance
        aws:cloud9:owner: AIDA42373V3XEXWC6AHSG
        aws:cloudformation:stack-name: aws-cloud9-keepercore-documentation-7135ada88b05425aa8a6238dd30b58af
        aws:cloudformation:stack-id: arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-2:882323420974:stack/aws-cloud9-keepercore-documentation-7135ada88b05425aa8a6238dd30b58af/d068f250-0fc7-11ec-a7db-0a05d1ef2266
    name: aws-cloud9-keepercore-documentation-7135ada88b05425aa8a6238dd30b58af
    ctime: '2021-09-24T15:37:30Z'
    instance_cores: 2
    instance_memory: 8
    instance_type: m5.large
    instance_status: stopped
    metadata:
    ancestors:
        cloud:
        name: aws
        id: aws
        account:
        name: someengineering
        id: '882323420974'
        region:
        name: us-east-2
        id: us-east-2
    kinds:
    - resource
    - aws_ec2_instance
    - instance
    - aws_resource

Count and filter your resources
-------------------------------
``count`` will give you the number of incoming elements.
This provides information on the number of items you are interacting with.

.. code-block:: bash

    > help count
    > match is(aws_ec2_instance) | count
    total matched: 1
    total unmatched: 0

This will count all ``aws_ec2_instance`` that are older than 24h.
Both commands are identical, the 2nd one makes use of predefined placeholder strings.

.. code-block:: bash

    > match is(aws_ec2_instance) ctime < -1d | count
    > match is(aws_ec2_instance) ctime < "@YESTERDAY@" | count

| ``help`` provides all available placeholder strings in section ``Valid placeholder string``
| ``match`` automatically filters for the ``reported`` section of the response. With commands like ``query`` you need to explicitly select the reported section.  ``ctime`` is then selected via ``reported.ctime``.

| ``count`` has another handy feature: building a sum over a provided parameter results. 
| In this case: ``reported.instance_cores``.
| This will sum the number of instance_cores for all ``aws_ec2_instances`` that were created before yesterday, groups them by reported.instance_cores results and counts the occurences of them.

.. code-block:: bash

    > match is(aws_ec2_instance) ctime < "@YESTERDAY@" | count reported.instance_cores
    2: 1                         ← Number of occurences of reported.instance_cores = 2
    1: 1                         ← Number of occurences of reported.instance_cores = 1
    total matched: 2
    total unmatched: 0

As a small reminder: ``reported.instance_cores`` references to data from matched ``aws_ec2_instances``

.. code-block:: bash

    > match is(aws_ec2_instance)
    reported:
    kind: aws_ec2_instance
    [...]
    ctime: '2021-09-24T15:37:30Z'    ← reported.ctime < "@YESTERDAY@"
    instance_cores: 2                ← reported.instance_cores
    [...]
    kinds:
    - resource
    - aws_ec2_instance
    - instance
    - aws_resource
    ---
    reported:
    kind: aws_ec2_instance
    [...]
    ctime: '2021-09-11T15:37:30Z'    ← reported.ctime < "@YESTERDAY@"
    instance_cores: 1                ← reported.instance_cores
    [...]
    kinds:
    - resource
    - aws_ec2_instance
    - instance
    - aws_resource
